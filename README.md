# Synthosphere_crsc01
# #Verilog Implementation
Design Hierarchy The implementation is structured using SystemVerilog modules. The main module contains the FSM logic, and auxiliary modules handle state assignments, transitions, and input handling.

# # Yosys
![begining yosis synthesis process](https://github.com/hiteshachar/Synthosphere_crsc01/assets/119096257/4697a098-4795-4bfe-9a1b-54de6166fe55)
We will be using Yosys for the synthesis of our Verilog designs.

It will convert our RTL design to a gate-level netlist.


Yosys uses a synthesis script to read a design from a Verilog file, synthesizes it to a gate-level netlist using the cell library and writes the synthesized results as a Verilog netlist. The synthesis script will be written by the user on the terminal.

We will consider the same example as mentioned above. To start Yosys just type yosys in the terminal.

We will start by reading our library files; this lets the synthesizer know what standard cells we are using:

'read_liberty -lib ../my_lib/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib`

Below is the Block diagram generated by the tool before synthesis. So to generate a block diagram use show top_module_name in the terminal.
 # # comparing test.v and netlist.v
